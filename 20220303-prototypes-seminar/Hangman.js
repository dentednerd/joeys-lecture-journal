/*
Write a `Hangman` constructor. This constructor will setup a new hangman game and instances will be created with the following properties:

wordToGuess: passed as an argument to the constructor
lives: initially 5
correctLetters: an array made of blank strings or a correct guess
e.g. guessing "r" for the word "crane" -> ['', 'r', '', '', ''];

Hangman will have a guessLetter method that will take a letter to guess and either:
1. fill in the appropriate letters
2. subtract a life if the guess is wrong
*/

function Hangman(wordToGuess) {
  //
}

module.exports = Hangman;
